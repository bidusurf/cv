        <strong>About Me</strong><br>
        In addition to working with software development and system administration,
        I enjoy sports very much, especially outdoor and extreme sports, such as surf, cycling and climbing.<br><br>

        I was born and raised in São Paulo, and moved to Florianópolis looking for a more pleasant life for me,
        and also for my children, when I have them.<br><br>

        I love life and the good things it offers, thus,
        I try to live each day on the most harmonious and right way possible.<br><br>

        I am a joyful person, and I like to be in places where people fell
        good and have fun. That makes me a communicative person, who always
        tries to create a relaxed environment for everyone around me.<br><br>

        I know that I still have a lot to learn, and that is why I like
        to be up-to-date and acquire knowledge in a natural way, besides being
        willing to study and research whenever necessary.
